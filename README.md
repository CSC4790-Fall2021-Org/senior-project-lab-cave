This is an 3D virtual immersive lab environment designed to promote safety and prevent injuries to create an effective and safe learning environment.

The lab environemtn was created using a Lidar scanner to emulate a real VIllanova Chemistry Lab and exported in to python based Vizard which is needed to be ran.

This code is to be used once the Vizard file has been transfered using TightVNC from the local machine connected to the Villanova's CAVE to the remote server.

Run this code on Vizard after turning on the applicable screens in the CAVE. Approach the screens using the lead glasses (infared bulbs attached) to format the screen.

Take the joystick and follow the instruction on the first Display in the main view.

Enjoy and learn!
